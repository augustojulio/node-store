# node-store
This is a basic RESTAPI made using [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [MongoDb](https://www.mongodb.com/)

I hope that you enjoy that!

#What am i using?

[Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [body-parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser)


## How run this?

1. Run the following command line to install all npm modules

  ```sh
  $ npm install
  ```
2. After this, have to run MongoDb

  ```sh
  $ sudo mongod
  ```
3. Now you can run the application

  ```sh
  $ npm start
  ```
4. If you want to run the unit tests

  ```sh

  ```
